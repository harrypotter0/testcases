# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp and Developed a Tribute Page.

**Thoughts**: I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent and also worked on first project on FreeCodeCamp (Tribute).
